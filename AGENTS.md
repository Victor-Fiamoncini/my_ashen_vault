## Project

Ashen Vault is a first-person dungeon crawler with PS1-style graphics, written in Python on top of
raylib (`raylib` package, imported as `pyray` and `raylib`). It is inspired by FromSoftware's King's
Field series but everything in it is original: never copy names, maps, story, art, music or other
assets from King's Field or any other existing game.

All textures, models and sounds are generated in code at startup. Do not add image or audio files to
the game; `docs/` holds the only images (logo and README screenshots).

## Commands

Tooling is managed with uv; Python and uv versions are pinned in `mise.toml`, `.tool-versions` and
`.python-version`. `mise run <task>` wraps the same commands.

```sh
uv sync                     # create/update .venv from uv.lock
uv run ashen-vault          # play
uv run pytest               # tests (headless, no window)
uv run pytest --cov         # tests + branch coverage; fails below fail_under in pyproject.toml
uv run ruff check --fix     # lint
uv run ruff format          # format
```

Before declaring work done, run all four checks: `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`,
`pytest --cov`, and a smoke run (below) if you touched anything that renders or runs per frame.
CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the first three.

## Smoke runs

The game has a headless-friendly debug mode. It opens a window for N fixed-timestep frames, writes a
screenshot and prints one `smoke:` line with the game state:

```sh
ASHEN_VAULT_SAVE=/tmp/ashen_test_save.json \
  uv run ashen-vault --map sunken_keep --at 15,21,180 --smoke 200 --script "wait:1.2 attack" --shot /tmp/out.png
```

- Always set `ASHEN_VAULT_SAVE` to a throwaway path so you never touch the player's real save
  (`~/.local/share/ashen_vault/save.json`).
- `--script` steps: `action` presses once, `action:1.5` holds for 1.5 s, `wait:1` pauses. Actions are
  the keys of `CONTROLS` in `src/ashen_vault/input.py`.
- Combat rolls are random, so HP in the `smoke:` line can vary between runs. Positions, scenes, flags
  and items are deterministic.
- On Wayland, `GLFW: Error: 65548` warnings are harmless.

## Layout

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/ashen_vault/world/`, `player/`, `ai/`, `save/` | Pure game logic. **No raylib imports here**; covered by `tests/` |
| `src/ashen_vault/render/` | Shaders (`shaders/ps1.*`), procedural textures, mesh builder, matrix rig, models |
| `src/ashen_vault/game.py` | Scenes and the main loop |
| `src/ashen_vault/ui/hud.py` | HUD, menus, dialogue boxes |
| `src/ashen_vault/audio/synth.py` | Synthesized sound effects |
| `src/ashen_vault/input.py` | Key bindings and the `--script` driver |
| `src/ashen_vault/maps/*.map` | Plain-text tile maps: `[meta]`, `[legend]`, `[grid]`, `[entities]` |
| `src/ashen_vault/dialogue.py` | NPC conversations and the shop list |
| `tests/` | pytest suite; `conftest.py` has a small test map |
| `docs/logo/make_logo.py` | Regenerates `docs/logo/ashen_vault.svg` |

## Conventions

- Python 3.11+ syntax; ruff settings in `pyproject.toml` (line length 110, double quotes).
- Use `util.rround` (round half away from zero) instead of built-in `round` in game math. The code was
  ported from Ruby and its numbers depend on that rounding.
- Keep new logic in the raylib-free packages where possible and add tests for it. `world/world.py`
  and `dialogue.py` are pure but still untested, which makes them good places to add coverage.
- Internal resolution is 320x240 (`screen.py`); UI coordinates are in that space.
- Map grids are whitespace-sensitive. Don't reformat `.map` files.
- Add dependencies with `uv add` (runtime) or `uv add --dev` (tooling), never by hand-editing
  `uv.lock`.

## Git

- Work on the `development` branch; `master` only receives fast-forward merges from it.
- Contributor workflow (PRs to `development`, DCO sign-off) is in CONTRIBUTING.md.
- Commit only when asked. Don't commit `.idea/`, screenshots outside `docs/`, or coverage files.
